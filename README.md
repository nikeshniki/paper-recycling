# paper-recycling
The environmental impact due to excessive use of paper has negative effects on trees and forest. 
Paper production utilizes nearly 40% of world's commercially cut timber. Millions of acres of forests are destroyed leading to 
deforestation disturbing the ecological balance. Many initiatives are being taken in India for recycling paper and reducing the hazards
associated with it. Shree Aniruddha Upasana Foundation (Mumbai, India) is one such organization which undertakes used paper
recycling projects. The foundation encourages using paper bags instead of plastic ones which again are a serious hazard to environment.
They accept old newspapers, notebooks and so on and recycle the same into paper bags, 
teaching aids and toys for children.
